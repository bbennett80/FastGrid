# FastGrid
Ag-Grid Demo with FastHTML

A fun little example of how to use [Ag-Grid](https://ag-grid.com/) with [FastHTML](https://about.fastht.ml). This example also shows how to use `style` and `cls`
(class) within a FastHTML tag (FT). Ag-Grid is a great javascript library from [Niall Crosby](https://blog.ag-grid.com/in-memory-of-niall-crosby/). *Thank you Naill.*

# Install

``` sh
pip install python-fasthtml
```

Run the app with `python main.py`. Navigate to your web browser here: [Ag-Grid Demo with FastHTML](http://localhost:5001/ag-grid-demo)
